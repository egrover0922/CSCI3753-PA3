multi_thread.c
  This file contains a shared circular buffer called shared_buff sb. This file creates multiple
  threads to address the consumer producer problem. The producer() function allows the producer 
  threads to read from the data from input file into the shared_buff. The consumer() function
  uses the consumer threads to read from the shared_buff, do a dns lookup on the hostname, 
  and write the data into the results.txt file.
  
to run the program:
  ./multi_thread #of_consumer_threads #of_producer_threads results.txt serviced.txt input/names1.txt
  input/names2.txt input/names3.txt input/names4.txt input/names5.txt
